# What Copilot Generated
The primary blocks that were suggested by #Copilot were the actions generated under the cleanup commands, and Copilot was helpful in 
being able to automate these functions and ensuring that the code is cleaning up the CSV file. By adding comments throughout the code, Copilot
was able to take those comments into consideration to ensure that it follows what I wanted it to do.
# What I modified
After looking what Copilot was able to do with the code, I made some modifications around various parts to ensure that all of the variables were
what I wanted them to be and made sure they were all consistent as well. Furthermore, I had to rewrite a couple of the parts, as Copilot had not
correctly do it as I wanted.
# What I learned
I learned that while using Copilot can be extremely helpful when it comes to Python, it is still not perfect and I cannot strictly rely on it
to code for me. Copilot was helpful in generating basic code, and preventing simple mistakes from tedious coding. It can be a really great
tool when used as a coding assistant, but not as the coder.
